# SNHU-CS-360
# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The application was intended to serve as a warehouse inventory management tool.  The user needed to be able to view the current inventory, update existing inventory quantities, add new items, and delete items.  The application also needed the capability to register new users.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There needed to be a login screen, a new user screen, an inventory screen, and an update items screen.  Some of these could have been combined if desired.  The UI needed to be simple and intuitive.  I achieved this by only including the required elements in the UI and app functionality.  Especially for the user input sections, hints were provided to ensure the user understood what was needed by the application.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I need to focus on testing each piece separately.  I think this was due to a lack of understanding working with Android Studio on how to test a screen before the navigation code was in place.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I attempted to test and use industry standards to ensure functionality.  Unfortunately, I could not get passed the login screen navigation to the inventory screen to be able to fully test.

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to do a lot of research outside of the course provided resources to attempt to fix my navigation coding issues.  No matter what I tried, I could not get it to work or understand why it wouldn't work.  I was also sick this week, so I wasn't quite able to outreach for additional help like I normally would have when struggling with course material.

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe the UI piece of the project was well thought out and executed.  I have enjoyed further developing those skills and plan to utilize them in the future.
